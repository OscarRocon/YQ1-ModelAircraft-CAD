# YQ-1 Model Aircraft

## 3D Printing Instructions
Each part should be printed using the following settings:

- **Filament:** eSUN PLA  
- **Nozzle Temperature:** 220°C  
- **Bed Temperature:** 60°C  
- **Infill Pattern:** 3% Gyroid (For wings, you may use **Lines** support, but Gyroid has provided better results in my experience.)  
- **Supports:** Use **Tree Supports** for **Fuselage Part 3** and **Fuselage Part 7** to ensure proper print quality.  
- **Layer Height:** 0.2mm recommended for a balance between detail and strength.  

## Recommended Components for Best Performance

- 🔋 **Battery:** 4S 2200 mAh LiPo  
- ⚙️ **Servos:** MG90S Micro Servos  
- 🌀 **Motor:** 1750+ Kv Brushless Motor  
- 📏 **Carbon Fiber Spars:** Two 500mm x 6mm diameter  
- 🔩 **Fasteners:** M3 screws  
- 🛠️ **Assembly:** Glue required for structural bonding (CA glue or epoxy recommended)  
- 🔗 **Servo Hinges:** Required for control surface movement  
- 📡 **Receiver & Transmitter:** Compatible RC system (minimum 4-channel recommended)  
- ⚡ **Electronic Speed Controller (ESC):** 30A+ ESC suitable for your motor and battery  

## Optional Upgrades for Advanced Features

- 🖥️ **Flight Controller:** F405-Wing or Matek F411 for stabilization and telemetry support  
- 📶 **GPS Module:** BN-220 or similar for autonomous navigation (if using a flight controller)  
- 🎛️ **Voltage Regulator (BEC):** 5V/3A BEC if your ESC does not have a built-in BEC  
- 🔋 **Battery Alarm or Voltage Checker:** To prevent over-discharging the LiPo battery  
- 🟢 **LED Navigation Lights:** For better visibility during dusk or night flying  

## Assembly & Usage Instructions

1. **Download** the CAD/STL files from this repository.  
2. **Print** the parts using the recommended 3D printing settings.  
3. **Prepare** components by sanding and dry-fitting before assembly.  
4. **Assemble** the aircraft using the recommended fasteners, carbon fiber spars, and glue for bonding.  
5. **Install Electronics:** Secure servos, motor, battery, **ESC, receiver, transmitter system, and optional flight controller/GPS** in their designated positions.  
6. **Attach Servo Hinges:** Ensure proper movement of control surfaces for accurate flight control.  
7. **Calibrate & Test:** Ensure control surfaces respond correctly, **check voltage levels**, and perform a **range check** with the transmitter.  
8. **Enjoy Flying** the YQ-1!
